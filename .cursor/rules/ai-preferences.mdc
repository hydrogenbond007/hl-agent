# AI Behavior Preferences

## Documentation Files

Do not create markdown documentation files (`.md`) unless explicitly requested by the user. This includes:
- README files
- CHANGELOG files
- Documentation in `docs/` directory
- Any other `.md` files

Only create these files when the user specifically asks for them.

## Code Explanation

When making code choices or implementation decisions, explain your reasoning clearly:

- Why you chose a particular approach over alternatives
- Trade-offs of the chosen solution
- Any assumptions you're making
- How the implementation fits with the existing codebase

Provide context and rationale to help the user understand not just *what* you're doing, but *why* you're doing it that way.
